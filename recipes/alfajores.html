    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Alfajores are a classic Argentinian sweet consisting of two shortbread cookies with a filling in the middle, typically dulce de leche. There are many different takes on the alfajor internationally as well, for instance the french variation is the Macaron. But it is hard to resist the airy and sweet Argentine Alfajores with their creamy caramel centre. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1.25 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp. baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tsp. baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Kosher salt</li>
        <li>8 tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
        <li>150g powdered sugar</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
        <li>0.75 cup dulce de leche, room temperature</li>
        <li>0.33 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>additional powdered sugar - for dusting onto tops of filled cookies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium sized bowl, combine the <strong>flour, corn starch, baking soda, baking powder</strong> and <strong>kosher salt</strong>. Whisk together thoroughly and set aside.</li>
        <li>To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the <strong>butter</strong> and <strong>powdered sugar</strong>. Beat together on medium speed until well combined. Scrape down sides of bowl.</li>
        <li>Add <strong>egg yolks</strong> one at a time, beating well between additions. Scrape down bowl to ensure mixture is well combined. Add <strong>vanilla</strong> and mix again.</li>
        <li>Add dry ingredients, mixing on low just until incorporated. Scrape the bowl several times to help ensure the butter mixture is fully blended in.</li>
        <li>Gather dough into a disc and place between two large sheets of parchment paper. Roll out dough to a thickness of ⅛". Refrigerate rolled dough (still in parchment) on an upside down baking sheet for 30+ minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177° Celsius).</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Loosen both layers of parchment paper, but keep the dough on a parchment base. Using a 2 inch round cookie cutter, cut out 32 circles.</li>
        <li>Evenly space the circles 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) apart on parchment lined baking sheets. Chill for 10 minutes prior to baking.</li>
        <li>Bake one sheet of cookies at a time for 10 minutes on center rack of oven. Cookie should be a light golden brown on the base, but still pale on top. Leave to fully cool on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining cookies.</li>
        <li>Fill a 16 inch (40 centimeter) piping bag with <strong>dulce de leche</strong>. Pipe approximately 14 grams (¾ Tablespoon) of dulce de leche onto the bottom of half of the cookies. Cover gently with the remaining cookies.</li>
        <li>Place the <strong>shredded coconut</strong>  into a small shallow bowl. Roll the edge of each cookie into the coconut so that it sticks to the dulce de leche filling.</li>
        <li>Place cookies back onto a baking sheet. Put <strong>powdered sugar</strong> into a fine mesh sieve and generously dust over the top of the cookies.</li>
    </ol>
