    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An empanada is a baked or fried pastry with a savory filling popular across Latin America and Spain. Typical fillings consist of meat (usually beef, chicken or ham) with potatoes, olives and other vegetables; however there are many variations on the basic turnover. In Argentina every region has a signature variation of the dish, whether that be size, spiciness or filling. They are a staple of the Argentinian diet, often served at parties, as an appetizer, or on the street as fast food.</p>
    <p>My family makes a variation of the Tucuman and La Roija Empanadas with beef, pepper, raisins, egg, potatoes and onions. The flour dough is filled and folded by hand. No matter how hard we try my Abuela always makes the prettiest ones!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 red bell peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. paprika</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. dried oregano</li>
        <li>1.5 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tsp. sugar</li>
        <li>0.5 cup raisins</li>
        <li>36 empanada/puff pastry dough rounds</li>
        <li>0.5 cup green olives, pitted and chopped</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>ground pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat <strong>2 tbsp. oil</strong> in a large pot over lshigh. Cook <strong>2 lb. ground beef</strong>, breaking up with a spoon, until browned but not completely cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving as much fat in pan as possible.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and cook <strong>2 medium onions</strong>, chopped, <strong>2 red bell peppers</strong>, seeded, chopped, and remaining <strong>1 tbsp. oil</strong>, stirring, until tender but not browned, 6-8 minutes; season with <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>black pepper</strong>. Add <strong>2 tbsp. ground cumin</strong>, <strong>2 tbsp. sweet paprika</strong>, <strong>1 tbsp. dried oregano</strong>, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add <strong>1.5 cups chicken broth</strong> and reserved beef along with any accumulated juices to pot. Stir in <strong>2 tsp. sugar, 4 tsp. salt, and 0.25 tsp. black pepper</strong>. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring and scraping up any brown bits, until most of the liquid is evaporated, 15–20 minutes; taste and season with <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>black pepper</strong>, if needed. Stir in <strong>0.5 cup raisins</strong> and <strong> 0.5 cup green olives</strong>. Transfer to a medium bowl, cover, and chill at least 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Let <strong>36 dough rounds</strong> sit at room temperature for 15 minutes to temper. Place <strong>2 tbsp. beef filling</strong>in the center of each round.</li>
        <li>Brush water around outer edge of each round and fold round over filling. Pinch edges to seal.</li>
        <li>Using a fork, crimp edges. Transfer empanadas to a parchment-lined sheet tray, spacing 2.5 cm apart. Repeat with remaining rounds (you’ll get about 12 empanadas on each tray).</li>
        <li>Bake empanadas, rotating tray halfway through, until golden brown and slightly darker around the edges, 25–35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!!</li>
